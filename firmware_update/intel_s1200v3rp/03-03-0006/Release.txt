                           INSTALLATION NOTES
================================================================================


WARNING:  It is very important to follow these instructions as they are written.
Failure to update using the proper procedure may cause damage to your system.

A:UEFI iFlash32 
   1.  Boot the system to EFI Shell
   2.  Copy IFlash32.efi, ipmi.efi and BIOS.CAP file to a USB Flash Drive
       ( Do not use the *Rec.CAP file as it will clear the NVRAM)
	   Notes: It is recommended to copy full package
   3.  Map the respective storage device in the system with the command
	   Shell> map -r
   4.  Change the Shell to mapped device file system
	   Example: Shell> fs0: (or fs1:)
   5.  Run the IFlash32 utility at the prompt
	   fs0:\> IFlash32 [File Name] /u /ni
   6.  Either reboot the system and Go into BIOS setup <F2>, reset defaults <F9>
       and save <F10> or After the BIOS update and before rebooting, 
       run: fS0:> Iflash32 -rd
   7.  Reboot the system

B:Backup BIOS update instructions
   1.  Boot the system to EFI Shell
   2.  Copy IFlash32.efi, ipmi.efi and BIOS .CAP file to a USB Flash Drive
       ( Do not use the *Rec.CAP file as it will clear NVRAM)
	   Notes: It is recommended to copy full package
   3.  Map the respective storage device in system with the command
	   Shell> map -r
   4.  Change the Shell to mapped device file system
	   Example: Shell> fs0: (or fs1:)
   5.  Run the IFlash32 utility on the prompt
       fs0:\> IFlash32 -u [File Name] UpdateBackupBios -ni
   6.  It will update primary BIOS with processed capsule, and the backup BIOS 
       update will be completed in next normal boot.
   7.  Reboot the system.
================================================================================
                        BIOS RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

The Recovery process can be initiated by setting the recovery jumper. (called 
BIOS Recovery Boot Jumper)
 
A BIOS recovery can be accomplished from the backup BIOS region or USB Mass Storage device. 
Please note that recovery from USB floppy is not supported on this platform. 
 
The recovery media must contain the following files under the root directory:
   1.  UEFI iFlash32 (including IFlash32.efi and ipmi.efi )
   2.  *Rec.CAP
   3.  Startup.nsh (update accordingly to use proper *Rec.CAP file)
 
BIOS starts the recovery process by first loading and booting to the recovery image from the 
backup BIOS region.

This process takes place before any video or console is available. Once the system boots 
to recovery image, it will boot automatically into EFI Shell to invoke the Startup.nsh 
script and start the flash update application (IFlash32.efi). IFlash32.efi requires the 
supporting BIOS Capsule image file (*Rec.CAP). After the update is complete, there will 
be a message displayed stating that the "BIOS has been updated successfully" indicating 
the recovery process is finished. The User should then switch the recovery jumper back to
normal operation and restart the system by performing a power cycle.
 
The following steps demonstrate this recovery process:
   1.  Power OFF the system.
   2.  Insert recovery media.(Optional if the backup BIOS region works)
   3.  Switch the recovery jumper. Details regarding the jumper ID and location
       can be obtained from the Product Board TPS.
   4.  Power ON the system.
   5.  The BIOS POST screen will appear displaying the progress and system automatically 
       boots to the EFI SHELL.
   6.  Startup.nsh file executes, and initiates the flash update (IFlash32.efi)
       with new capsule file (*Rec.CAP). The regular IFlash message will be displayed at
       the end of the process, once the flash update succeeds.
   7.  Power OFF the system, and revert the recovery jumper position to "normal".
   8.  Power ON the system. 
   9.  Do *NOT* interrupt the BIOS POST during the first boot.

                            KNOWN ISSUES/WORKAROUNDS
================================================================================
- If you want to install Linux* SUSE* 11 SP2 or boot to a pre-installed Linux* SUSE* 11 SP2 OS, 
- R02.01.0002 and later version need use command "iflash32 -u RB_R02.0x.xxxxRec.cap UpdateBackupBios -ni" 
  to upgrade from R01.04.0002 and early version. Similarly, R01.04.0002 and early version need use command 
  "iflash32 -u RB_R01.0x.xxxxRec.cap UpdateBackupBios -ni" to downgrade from R02.01.0002 and later version.
- As security requirement, R03.01.0001 reversion doesn't support capsule downgrade in normal mode.
- R03.01.0002 is the first BIOS that adds support for Intel(R) Xeon processor E3-1200 V4 series. If you
  are upgrading from R02.02.0004 or earlier BIOS versions,  you will need to use a Intel(R) Xeon processor E3-1200 V3 
  series processor first to boot to EFI shell and use capsule files to update BIOS to R03.01.0002.
  After flashing with the Intel(R) Xeon processor E3-1200 V3 series processor, you can install
  the Intel(R) Xeon processor E3-1200 V4 series processor and boot.  
  Because of BMC late response, probably BMC LAN IP address can't show correctly in setup. W/A is to do warm reset or DC reset.

================================================================================
             ME Changes in 03.00.07.024
================================================================================

===============================================================================
			ME Changes in 03.00.07.013
================================================================================

================================================================================
- Fixed: Steps to reproduce: 0. Burn new image NMon (SKU NM) AlwaysOn 1. Boot to OS 2.
		Execute power flows in random way Expected results: Platform should properly
		execute power flow. Actual results: After 59 iteration ME send E3 00 command
		
================================================================================
			  ME Changes in 03.00.05.128
================================================================================
- Fixed: Bit Reserved16 in PCH Strap 15 is set incorrectly. This change in Flash 
       Descriptor was introduced in previous release and reverted in this one.

         LM25066i chip is used.
- Fixed: After ME reset (Cold Reset command, or any host reset in S0/S1 Only power
         mode except host warm reset) ME returns incorrect version and CRC of mPhy
         settings (0). This causes the BIOS to perform (unnecessary) mPhy settings 
         update in ME, which gets rejected with 0x101E error code while it should
         be accepted.
- Fixed: Sporadically on some platforms ME may be reset during host booting due
         to internal exception.
- Fixed: ¡°Read mPhy settings¡± HECI message returns ICC_STATUS_FAILURE (0x0001)
         in ¡°ICC Status¡± field.
- Fixed: PCH register SECRT98 (SATA Electrical Control Register T98) has improper
         value due to incorrect mPhy settings value in ME. As a workaround the BIOS 
         may force update of these settings during boot.

			  ME Changes in 03.00.04.209
================================================================================   
- Fixed: Disabling spectrum spread with ICC_SET_SPREAD_SPECTRUM message over HECI
         causes the BIOS to hang.
- Fixed: When PSU Status sensors are disabled and one of the PSUs gets disconnected
         from AC, ME resets due to exception, causing SPS FW Health sensor 0x17 event
         to be stored in the BMC SEL.
- Fixed: When Factory Defaults are restored using IPMI command, there is incorrect
         SPS FW Health sensor 0x17 event sent to the BMC SEL.
- Fixed: Sometimes Dynamic Core Allocation temporarily parks cores in unexpected
- Fixed: Sometimes aggressive power policy in Domain Total is not able to limit 
         power in specified correction time.
