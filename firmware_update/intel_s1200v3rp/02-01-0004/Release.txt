To update from Windows* Preboot Execution Environment (WinPE)

The System Firmware Update Package can be inserted to Windows* PE customized image

- Boot server with customized WinPE CD
- Run script "WinPE21_x64_Update.bat" or "WinPE20_x86_Update.bat" 
  (name may be varied depends on your own customization)
  
Note:
1. The Intel(R) OFU utility is case sensitive. Therefore, when you transfer the 
Firmware Update Package using USB flash drive from a Microsoft Windows* system to a Linux
environment, you must first extract under the Linux* environment. Otherwise, you 
will need to mount the USB flash drive manually with 'vfat' option under Linux to avoid 
conversion from upper case to lower case and vice versa.

2. To make Intel(R) OFU utility run properly under x86 or x64 OS, you have to read
OFU release notes on known issues for OFU installation.

3. In this SFUP package, Intel only provide batch file "WinPE_x86_Update.bat"
for WinPE2.0 32 bit solution "WinPE_x64_Update.bat" for WinPE2.1/3.0 64 bit 
solution as an example. Please refer to white paper "White Paper-Intel Server 
Utilities Procedure for WinPE.pdf" for details on building your own customized 
WinPE CD.

4. Windows PE 2.0 - built from Windows Vista SP1 32bit or EM64T
5. Windows PE 2.1 - built from Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008, EM64T
6. Windows PE 3.1 - built from Windows Server 2008R2, EM64T
7. Microsoft IPMI driver is loaded by default from WinPE CD, if you want to use 
Intel IPMI driver instead of MS IPMI driver for firmware update, you can un-install
Microsoft IPMI driver by:
                Devicesetup.exe ¨Cv remove *IPI0001
                Note: IPI0001 is the device ID for Microsoft IPMI driver.
